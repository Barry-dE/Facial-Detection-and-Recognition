# Face Detection Thingy (forgive my lack of a better name)

## Description 
A program that  enables users to access their webcam, capture images from the video stream, and perform facial detection and recognition on the captured images. This is just an experiment, for now.

Forgive the spaghetti code. As I gain more clarity with time, I'll make it a web app and add other functionalities. I am open to ideas and collaboration on this.
